Platform for NFT traders based on Ethereum Blockchain
As of December 2021, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have generated over $22 billion in sales, and several companies like OpenSea, Sorare, and Sky Maven have secured billion-dollar valuations. 1 Market intelligence firms have begun providing tools that summarize sales and price data for different NFT collections and present this information to market participants. These statistics are often cited in the media to compare different collections. However, they do not account for differences in marketplace design, which may result in misleading comparisons between collections sold through different marketplaces. We demonstrate the impact that marketplace design can have on market intelligence. Specifically, we focus on bidding costs, which depend on the marketplaceâ€™s policies regarding transaction fees, bidding bots, or the user interface for placing bids. Most NFT marketplaces are peer-to-peer (similar to Ebay). They require sellers to list an item for a fixed price but also enable participants to place bids that are typically lower than listing prices. Sellers can choose to accept the bid or wait for someone to purchase the item for the listing price or make another bid.
